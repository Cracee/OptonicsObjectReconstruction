# <span id='intro'>Introduction</span>

The repository of the Master Project of Cracee. Goal is to reconstruct 3D Objects via a top view in bins.

# <span id='sub'>Subfolder Explanation</span>

For this project, there are different subfolders:

In Registration you can find the 1. Try, with manual ICP Algorithms, to puzzle together an object from different subparts.

In nxlib_tutorials you can find some Tutorials from the Ensenso SDK Website. They are used to test the environment, if camera communication works etc.

The OMNet_Pytorch-main [omnet], prnet-master and UTOPIC-main folders contain DL approaches, which will get fitted to this project in the next days and weeks.
